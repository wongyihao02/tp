## **Design & implementation**

This section describes some important details on how certain features in TASync are implemented.

### Command Package Structure

The `command` package contains the following sub-packages:

- `attendancelistcommands` - Handles commands related to attendance lists.
- `commandhandler` - Manages the processing and execution of various commands
- `student commands` - Implements commands specific to student-related operations
- `taskcommands` - Contains commands for managing tasks
- `tutorialcommands` - Handles tutorial-related commands


### Attendance List Commands

### Command Handler 

### **Student Commands**

The `studentcommands` package includes commands that handle student-related functionalities in TASync. 
These commands interact with the tutorial classes and the student list, allowing users to manage student records 
effectively. 


#### 1. NewStudentCommand

The NewStudentCommand is part of the `studentcommands` package and is responsible for adding a new student to a
specific tutorial class.

#### Implementation Details

The NewStudentCommand class implements the Command<TutorialClassList> interface. It is responsible for parsing the input to
extract the student’s details, validating them, and adding the student to the appropriate tutorial class.
#### Operations

The class implements the following main operation:

- `NewStudentCommand#execute()`
- Parses the input to extract the student’s name, date of birth (DOB), gender, contact number, matriculation number, and tutorial class code. 
- Validates the student details to ensure they are correctly formatted and do not contain any errors. 
- Retrieves the specified tutorial class based on the provided class code. 
- Checks if the matriculation number already exists in the class. If it does, an error message is shown. 
- Creates a new Student object and adds it to the student list of the tutorial class. 
- Logs and displays a success message if the student is successfully added to the tutorial class. 
- Handles any exceptions by displaying relevant error messages if validation fails or the tutorial class is not found.

#### 2. DeleteStudentCommand
#### Implementation Details
#### Operations

#### 3. ChangeRemarkCommand

The `ChangeRemarkCommand` is part of the `studentcommands` package and is responsible for modifying the remark of a
student in a specific tutorial class.

#### Implementation Details

The `ChangeRemarkCommand` class implements the `Command<TutorialClassList>` interface and modifies a student's remark based 
on the provided tutorial class code and matriculation number.

#### Operations

The class implements the following main operation:

- `ChangeRemarkCommand#execute()`
  - Parses the input to extract the tutorial class code, matriculation number and new remark.
  - Retrieves the specified tutorial class and student.
  - Updates the student's remark and displays a confirmation message.
  - If the tutorial class or student is not found, an error message is shown.

This command is executed as part of the TASync system when a user provides a properly formatted input string.


#### 4. CheckRemarkCommand
#### Implementation Details
#### Operations

#### 5. FindStudentCommand
#### Implementation Details
#### Operations


### Task Commands

#### 1. DeleteTaskCommand

The `DeleteTaskCommand` handles the removal of tasks from the system. It searches for the specified task by its number and removes it from the task list if found. If the task is not found, an error message is displayed.

#### Implementation Details

The `DeleteTaskCommand` class implements the `Command<TaskList>` interface and interacts with the `TaskList` to remove tasks.

#### Operations

- `DeleteTaskCommand#execute()`
  - Retrieves the task to be deleted based on user input.
  - Removes the task from the `TaskList`.
  - Displays a confirmation message upon successful removal.
  - If the task is not found, an error message is shown.
